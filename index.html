					SpaceX has signed the world’s first private passenger to fly around the Moon aboard our BFR launch vehicle - an important step toward enabling access for everyday people who dream of traveling to space.
					Only 24 humans have been to the Moon in history. No one has visited since the last Apollo mission in 1972. Find out who’s flying and why on Monday, September 17 at 6pm PT.

			<p>
				SpaceX has gained worldwide attention for a series of historic milestones. It is the only private company capable of returning a spacecraft 
				from low Earth orbit, which it first accomplished in 2010. The company made history again in 2012 when its Dragon spacecraft became the 
				first commercial spacecraft to deliver cargo to and from the International Space Station. SpaceX successfully achieved the historic first 
				reflight of an orbital class rocket in 2017, and the company now regularly launches flight-proven rockets. In 2018, SpaceX began launching Falcon Heavy, the world’s most powerful operational rocket by a factor of two.
				As one of the world’s fastest growing providers of launch services, SpaceX has secured over 100 missions to its manifest, representing over $12 billion on contract. These include commercial satellite launches as well as US government missions. SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft is flying numerous cargo resupply missions to the space station under a series of Commercial Resupply Services contracts. Dragon was designed from the outset to carry crew to space, and as early as 2018, SpaceX will carry astronauts as part of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program.
				Building on the achievements of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy, SpaceX is working on a next generation of fully reusable launch vehicles that will be the most powerful ever built, capable of carrying humans to Mars and other destinations in the solar system.
